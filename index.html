      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The temperature at which pipes freeze in Shingle Springs, CA, is influenced by several factors such as pipe material, insulation, and external environmental conditions. Freezing temperatures can cause significant damage to plumbing systems, particularly in older homes where insulation may be inadequate. This guide explains what temperature pipes freeze at, common causes, and how to prevent such issues in Shingle Springs.</p>

      <h2>Key Terminology</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pipe Freeze Point</dt>
        <dd>The temperature at which water inside pipes freezes, typically around 32°F (0°C) but can vary based on insulation and water flow.</dd>
        <dt>Insulation</dt>
        <dd>Material used to reduce heat transfer, often applied to pipes to prevent freezing during cold temperatures.</dd>
        <dt>Hydro Jetting</dt>
        <dd>A method of cleaning pipes using high-pressure water to remove blockages and prevent future freezing by maintaining clear flow.</dd>
        <dt>Trenchless Technology</dt>
        <dd>A method for replacing or repairing pipes without digging, minimizing disruption to property during plumbing work.</dd>

      <h2>Process & Diagnostics</h2>
      <p>Preventing frozen pipes involves several diagnostic steps, including identifying vulnerable areas in the plumbing system and applying targeted insulation. The process starts with evaluating the pipe materials and external temperature, followed by detecting weak spots using advanced technology such as camera inspections. If frozen pipes are found, solutions like hydro jetting or trenchless technology may be used to resolve the issue.</p>
